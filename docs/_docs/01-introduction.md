</p>

CathAction offers several a large-scale dataset encompassing several endovascular intervention tasks such as segmentation, collision detection, and action understanding. To our knowledge, CathAction represents the largest and most realistic dataset specifically tailored for surgical equipment catheter and guidewire tasks.

## Statistics

The distribution of action classes in both animal and phantom data of CathAction illustrates the variety of action segment lengths, showcasing the significant variability in segment duration.

The adaptation property of our CathAction datasets shared between the phantom data and the animal data. This distinctive domain gap feature
renders the CathAction dataset a formidable benchmark for evaluating domain adaptation.
