Our **CathAction** dataset encompasses approximately **500,000** annotated frames for catheterization action understanding task as: Catheterization Anticipation and Recognition

**Action:** These classes belong to three groups: catheter (advance catheter and retract catheter), guidewire (advance guidewire and retract guidewire), and one action involving both the catheter and guidewire (rotate).
